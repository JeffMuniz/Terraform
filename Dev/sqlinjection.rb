#Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries.
 #Ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized or parameterized in Active Record queries.

# Assuming you have a User model
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# Example of a vulnerable query without parameterization
def vulnerable_query(username)
  User.where("username = '#{username}'").first
end

# Example of a safe query using parameterization
def safe_query(username)
  User.where("username = ?", username).first
end
#the username variable is passed separately from the 
#SQL query, which prevents SQL injection attacks because the ActiveRecord
 #framework handles proper sanitization and parameterization internally
 n Ruby on Rails, when you define a class like User < ActiveRecord::Base, you're creating a model class called User that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base.

Here's what each part means:

class User: This line defines a new class named User.
< ActiveRecord::Base: This part of the code indicates that the User class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, which is the base class provided by the ActiveRecord library. This inheritance allows the User class to gain all the functionality and methods provided by ActiveRecord::Base.
In the context of a Rails application, when you define a model class like User that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, you're essentially creating a representation of a database table. Each instance of the User class corresponds to a row in the users table in the database. By inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base, the User class 
gains access to methods and features provided by ActiveRecord for interacting 
with the database, such as querying, creating, updating, and deleting records.

For example, with the User model defined as above, you can use methods like
 User.find, User.where, User.create, etc., to interact with the users table in the database.

Overall, this line of code is crucial in defining the structure and behavior of the
 User model in your Ruby on Rails application, enabling it to interact with the underlying database using ActiveRecord conventions.




User
so in this case the < is not an operator
ChatGPT
That's correct. In the context of class User < ActiveRecord::Base, the < symbol is 
not functioning as an operator. Instead, it's part of the Ruby syntax used for class inheritance. 
It signifies that the User class is inheriting behavior and attributes from the ActiveRecord::Base class. 
This is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming in Ruby, where classes can inherit behavior and attributes 
from other classes, allowing for code reuse and organization.
